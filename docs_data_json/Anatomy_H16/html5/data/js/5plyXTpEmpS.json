similarly abrupt transition occurs in the structure of the ascending limb as it changes back from a squamous to a cuboidal epithelium, and is now called the thick ascending limb. The cuboidal epithelium of the thick ascending limb reflects its function in active ion transport. Its apical surface has some short microvilli and its lateral surfaces have some interdigitations, but these features are much more highly developed in the PCT. The basal surfaces of these epithelial cells are remarkable in the elaborate infoldings of its basal membrane and the numerous mitochondria associated with them. Very functionally important are the highly-developed tight junctions between adjacent cells in this tubular segment. The functional significance of these features will be explained. The thick ascending limb returns to the cortex, and passes between the afferent and efferent arterioles of the nephron, where its lining cells are modified to form the macula densa.
