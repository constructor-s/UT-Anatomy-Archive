back at the renal corpuscle, glomerular filtrate is iso-osmotic to plasma. In the PCT, equal amounts of solute and water are absorbed, and therefore, the tubular fluid entering the loop of Henle is also iso-osmotic to plasma. Because the descending thin limb is freely permeable to water, water is absorbed from the filtrate as it passes through this segment, and the absorbed water is reclaimed by the vasae rectae carrying blood back toward the cortex. The tubular filtrate equilibrates with the renal interstitium and its osmolality, too, becomes 4x plasma at the apex of the renal medulla. \nBecause the ascending thin limb is impermeable to water, but freely permeable to salts, salts move from the filtrate into the interstitium in response to the osmotic gradient as the fluid moves through the thin ascending limb. Now weâ€™re back at the thick ascending limb, where salts are actively removed from the filtrate, but water cannot follow. This creates in the hypo-osmotic tubular fluid that enters the distal convoluted tubule (DCT).","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":305}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":437,"height":364,"strokewidth":0}},"width":436,"height":363,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6895qNhERS8"},{"kind":"image","btnxpos":28,"btnypos":356,"zoomiconurl":"story_content/zoomIcon.png","zoomtype":"flashwindow","zoomslide":false,"zoomdata":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"imagedata":{"assetId":38,"url":"","type":"normal","width":0,"height":0,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0},"html5data":{"url":"6dvDbxfQYRW_DX449_DY599_CX449_CY599.png","xPos":262,"yPos":0,"width":449,"height":599,"strokewidth":0,"mask":"41A97X"}},"accType":"none","shapemaskId":"","xPos":10,"yPos":64,"tabIndex":2,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":-4,"yOffset":-4,"rotateXPos":143.5,"rotateYPos":192,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"imagedata":{"assetId":51,"url":"","type":"normal","width":0,"height":0,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0},"html5data":{"url":"Shape6JOa2esOC7O.png","xPos":-4,"yPos":-4,"width":299,"height":397,"strokewidth":0,"mask":"12DO122X6O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X5O124X6O123X5DBO"}},"width":287,"height":384,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6JOa2esOC7O"}],"startTime":-1,"elapsedTimeMode":"normal","useHandCursor":false,"resume":false,"kind":"slidelayer","isBaseLayer":true}]}
