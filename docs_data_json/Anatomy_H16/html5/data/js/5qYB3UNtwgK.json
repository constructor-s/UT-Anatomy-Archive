that the peritubular capillaries of the juxtaglomerular nephrons give rise to the vasa recta. The course of the vasa recta parallels that of the loops of Henle: they enter the medulla from the cortex, make a hairpin turn and return to the cortex to empty into the arcuate veins. Between them, the loops of Henle and the vasa recta function to generate a high osmotic pressure in the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla. This is achieved by the different permeability characteristics of the regions of the loops in a process known as the counter-current exchange mechanism. As you will see, the functional significance of the high osmotic pressure in the renal medullary interstitium is that it acts as a force capable of drawing water out of the renal filtrate passing through the renal collecting ducts, thus conserving water and concentrating urine.
