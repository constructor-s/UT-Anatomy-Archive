digestive tract is a single (albeit convoluted) tube that has three subdivisions: the foregut, midgut and hindgut. It receives its blood supply from three, unpaired, visceral branches of the abdominal aorta. The foregut receives its blood supply from the celiac trunk, the midgut from the superior mesenteric artery and the hindgut from the inferior mesenteric artery. \nThese vessels arise from the aorta in the posterior body wall. In order for their branches to gain access to intraperitoneal organs, they must pass through mesenteries or ligaments,  the latter being structures analogous to mesenteries, but smaller. Like mesenteries, ligaments consist of two layers of serous membrane with loose CT, adipose, Ns, BVs and Ls sandwiched between them.\nThe focus of this dissection is the foregut.
