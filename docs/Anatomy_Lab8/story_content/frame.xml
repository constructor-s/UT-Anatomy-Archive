      <slidetext slideid="6MT7kPXCadU.5UrViaqNt47" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 8a   the conducting system of the heart  next previous as you learned in the histology emodule on muscle tissue, cardiac muscle is intrinsically contractile.; i.e. individual myocardial cells contract in the absence of neural input. you’ll also recall that electrical impulses travel between adjacent myocardial cells via gap junctions.  in order for this intrinsically contractile tissue to do useful work – i.e. to move blood from one chamber to the next – the contraction of the myocardium must be coordinated. this is the function of the the conducting system of the heart.  it ensures that the two atria contract and empty simultaneously while the ventricles are relaxed, and then that the two ventricles contract and empty simultaneously while the atria are relaxed.  the conducting system of the heart consists of specialized myocardial cells that form the: sinoatrial, or sa node,  atrioventricular, or av node atrioventricular or av bundle right and left bundle branches  purkinje fibres signals passing through this system of specialized myocardial cells coordinates the contraction of the atrial and ventricular myocardium. 7</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="6MT7kPXCadU.5bfaXEmhobk" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 8a   the fibrous skeleton of the heart  next previous however, if myocardial cells are joined by gap junctions, what prevents the spread of electrical signals, and therefore contraction, from the atrial myocardium directly to the ventricular myocardium? read on…. the fibrous skeleton of the heart is composed of dense connective tissue. it forms fibrous rings around each of the four heart valves. because dense ct is inextensible, these rings define the size of the opening of each valve. the fibrous rings provide attachment for the valve cusps. they also provides attachment for the myocardium of the atrium and that of the ventricles. in addition, it provides an insulating barrier between the two, thus preventing the direct spread of contractile impulses from the myocardium of the atria to that of the ventricles. therefore, the contraction of the ventricles must wait for the impulse to arrive from the av node by way of the av bundle, which passes through the fibrous skeleton of the heart, as shown below. 8 the heart valves as seen with the atria removed.</slidetext>

      <slidetext slideid="6MT7kPXCadU.6YVAc6zg2xJ" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 8a   sympathetic innervation of the heart   next previous 10 sympathetic activation increases the rate and force of contraction of the heart.  sympathetic output destined to innervated targets in the face and thorax arises from the upper four or five thoracic spinal levels. preganglionic fibres destined to innervated the heart join the sympathetic chain through the white rami communicantes and synapse onto postganglionic neurons in cervical and upper thoracic ganglia. axons arising from these postganglionic sympathetic neurons form cardiac splanchnic nerves which contribute to the cardiac plexus.</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="6MT7kPXCadU.5b1AFopQCg5" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 8a   parasympathetic innervation of the heart   next previous 11 parasympathetic activation decreases both heart rate and force of contraction. in addition, it constricts coronary arteries. cardiac branches of the vagus nerves join the cardiac plexus. the plexus thus contains a mixture of sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres. it consists of a superficial part between the aortic arch and the pulmonary trunk, and a deep part between the aortic arch and the tracheal bifurcation. parasympathetic ganglia containing parasympathetic postganglionic neurons are located both in the plexus and in the walls of the atria.</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="6MT7kPXCadU.6WHfOagnXY0" slidebank="false" type="slide">sensory fibres from the heart travel with both the vagus nerves and the sympathetic cardiac nerves.  vagal sensory fibres carry information such as blood gas and blood pressure from the aortic body and sinus, respectively     . this information returns to the brainstem with the vagus nerves, and informs cardiac reflex function. sensory fibres traveling with the sympathetic cardiac nerves carry nociceptive     signals that are interpreted by the cns as pain. cardiac nociceptors respond strongly to ischemia     , as occurs during myocardial infarction     . these signals travel along sensory fibres in the sympathetic cardiac nerves back to cervical and upper thoracic levels of the sympathetic chain. sensory fibres do not synapse in the chain, but simply pass through on the way back to upper thoracic levels of the spinal cord, from which the sympathetic motor outflow originated. the cell bodies of these sensory fibres are located in dorsal root ganglia at these same levels.  8a   sensory innervation of the heart   next previous 12 referred pain info in the spinal cord, sensory fibres from the heart overlap with sensory fibres reporting nociception from the corresponding dermatomes. the cns cannot differentiate the sources of the incoming nociceptive signals, and interprets it as coming from body wall. thus, cardiac pain refers to the medial arm and upper chest, which are the dermatomes corresponding to the level of sympathetic outflow to the heart.  info: these are the vagal corollary to the carotid body and sinus, monitored by the glossopharyngeal nerve.  nociceptive signals: = signals that arise in response to tissue damage  ischemia: = lack of oxygen  infarction: lack of blood delivery </slidetext>

(flexor) compartment of the arm. notice that the profunda brachii is the major vessel of the posterior (extensor) compartment of the arm. the humeral nutrient artery, which supplies much of the blood to the shaft of the humerus, is also a branch of the brachial artery, although you won’t be able to see it. a rich anastomosis exists around the elbow, as around the knee. connections between descending collateral arteries and ascending recurrent arteries, create this anastomosis. in the cubital fossa, the brachial pulse can be palpated medial to the tendon of the biceps brachii. one places a stethoscope here to listen for the brachial pulse while taking a blood pressure reading.</slidetext>
