to the erector spinae is a second group of intrinsic back muscles, the transversospinalis. As their name suggests, they run from the transverse process of one vertebra to the spinous process of another, filling in the gutter between these vertebral processes bilaterally, along the length of the vertebral column. \\nBecause of their attachments, when they contract unilaterally, they pull the spinous processes out of line, thereby rotating the vertebral column. When they contract bilaterally, however, they are able to exert equal pull on the spinous processes on both sides and therefore extend the vertebral column.\\nWhile they are not demonstrated in the prosection, they are beautifully presented in specimens in Grantâ€™s Museum, which you are to look at. \\nLike the erector spinae, the transversospinalis are subdivided into three groups, but in this case they are arranged from superficial to deep. The superficial fibres are the longest, spanning up to six vertebrae, and the deepest fibres are the shortest, spanning as few as one or two vertebrae.","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":1796}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":473,"height":386,"strokewidth":0}},"width":472,"height":385,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6YUIU8iikzl"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"text","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"","textLib":[{"kind":"textdata","uniqueId":"5V62GjWNOCO_2118251272","id":"01","linkId":"txt__default_5V62GjWNOCO","type":"vectortext","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":0,"height":0,"shadowIndex":-1,"vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":82,"bottom":28,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":266}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":612,"yPos":8,"tabIndex":2,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":46,"rotateYPos":16.5,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":5,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":92,"bottom":33,"altText":"7","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":157}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":93,"height":34,"strokewidth":0}},"width":92,"height":33,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"5V62GjWNOCO"},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"button","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"onrelease","textLib":[{"kind":"textdata","uniqueId":"6SnZIdN9TMZ_-1123847565","id":"01","linkId":"txt__default_6SnZIdN9TMZ","type":"vectortext","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":0,"height":0,"shadowIndex":-1,"vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":90,"bottom":22,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":34}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":8,"yPos":510,"tabIndex":6,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":52,"rotateYPos":12,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":6,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":-2,"top":-2,"right":105,"bottom":25,"altText":"Previous","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":33}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":105,"height":25,"strokewidth":2}},"width":104,"height":24,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6SnZIdN9TMZ","events":[{"kind":"onrelease","actions":[{"kind":"gotoplay","window":"_current","wndtype":"normal","objRef":{"type":"string","value":"_player.5YBYyguevHW.6AJWgLwvIEZ"}}]},{"kind":"onkeypress","keycode":37,"shift":false,"ctrl":false,"alt":false,"actions":[{"kind":"gotoplay","window":"_current","wndtype":"normal","objRef":{"type":"string","value":"_player.5YBYyguevHW.6AJWgLwvIEZ"}}]}]},{"kind":"vectorshape","rotation":0,"accType":"button","cliptobounds":false,"defaultAction":"onrelease","textLib":[{"kind":"textdata","uniqueId":"6ZoEXHjKVIZ_-203480438","id":"01","linkId":"txt__default_6ZoEXHjKVIZ","type":"vectortext","xPos":0,"yPos":0,"width":0,"height":0,"shadowIndex":-1,"vectortext":{"left":0,"top":0,"right":64,"bottom":22,"pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":36}}}],"shapemaskId":"","xPos":624,"yPos":510,"tabIndex":7,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":0,"yOffset":0,"rotateXPos":44,"rotateYPos":12,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"depth":7,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"vectorData":{"left":-2,"top":-2,"right":89,"bottom":25,"altText":"Next","pngfb":false,"pr":{"l":"Lib","i":35}},"html5data":{"xPos":-1,"yPos":-1,"width":89,"height":25,"strokewidth":2}},"width":88,"height":24,"resume":false,"useHandCursor":true,"id":"6ZoEXHjKVIZ","events":[{"kind":"onrelease","actions":[{"kind":"gotoplay","window":"_current","wndtype":"normal","objRef":{"type":"string","value":"_player.5YBYyguevHW.5yHg5bcQsqk"}}]},{"kind":"onkeypress","keycode":39,"shift":false,"ctrl":false,"alt":false,"actions":[{"kind":"gotoplay","window":"_current","wndtype":"normal","objRef":{"type":"string","value":"_player.5YBYyguevHW.5yHg5bcQsqk"}}]}]},{"kind":"image","btnxpos":28,"btnypos":418,"zoomiconurl":"story_content/zoomIcon.png","zoomtype":"flashwindow","zoomslide":false,"zoomdata":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"imagedata":{"assetId":334,"url":"","type":"normal","width":0,"height":0,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0},"html5data":{"url":"5pXeQ4hAQr0_DX354_DY650_CX354_CY650.png","xPos":309,"yPos":0,"width":354,"height":650,"strokewidth":0,"mask":"382D4X"}},"accType":"none","shapemaskId":"","xPos":4,"yPos":50,"tabIndex":4,"tabEnabled":true,"xOffset":-4,"yOffset":-4,"rotateXPos":121.5,"rotateYPos":223,"scaleX":100,"scaleY":100,"alpha":100,"rotation":0,"depth":8,"scrolling":true,"shuffleLock":false,"data":{"hotlinkId":"","accState":0,"imagedata":{"assetId":333,"url":"","type":"normal","width":0,"height":0,"mobiledx":0,"mobiledy":0},"html5data":{"url":"Shape6TAkLgr5Pej.png","xPos":-4,"yPos":-4,"width":254,"height":459,"strokewidth":3,"mask":"100OF5X6OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X5OF7X
