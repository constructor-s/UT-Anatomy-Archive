      <slidetext slideid="6WPJoLsOIZn.6fd626zjevw" slidebank="false" type="slide">we have been challenged with teaching / learning neuroanatomy over a short period of time. it’s critical that you learn what i teach, as i teach it. with neuroanatomy, more so than any other topic in anatomy, each lesson builds on the last. you will only frustrate yourself if you do delay learning. in unit 6, there is a lot more content that i’ll assign in the form of self-learning modules. i do, however, walk you through a fair bit of it using slide talks. clinical neuroanatomy is ultimately about two questions: 1) where is the lesion? and 2) what is the lesion? you first must learn some neuroanatomy before you can localize a lesion, so you’ll start with that. labs are run differently in unit 6. groups will be smaller (4-5 people) because the specimens you will study, brains and brainstems, are smaller.  at stg, each lab room is equipped with 8 stations, each of which includes a whole brain and a half brain. stg students will be divided into 8 groups as follows: pairs 1 (a1 &amp; b1) on the left side of the room go to one table, forming group ab1 pairs 2 (a2 &amp; b2) on the left side of the room go to the next table, forming group ab2 pairs 3 (a3 &amp; b3) on the left side of the room go to the third table, forming group ab3 pairs 4 (a4 &amp; b4) on the left side of the room go to the fourth table, forming group ab4 similarly, on the right side of the room, four groups are formed designated cd1, cd2, cd3 and cd4.  some resources are limited; you will rotate through the practical exercises in these groups so as to equitably share the specimens. at mam, students are divided into six groups of 4-5 students each. your ta will fill you in on the details. unit 6 overview previous next </slidetext>

      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.6ChdakQUHQh" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   cerebellar inputs 4 previous next the cerebellum receives input from a number of sources, all ipsilateral, unless otherwise noted.  the vestibular apparatus provides information regarding the static position of the head and its acceleration through space via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. proprioceptors in the face and body provide information regarding joint position, and therefore our position in space, predominantly via the inferior cerebellar peduncles.  visual and auditory input reaches the cerebellum from the superior and inferior colliculi, respectively, via the superior cerebellar peduncle.  the only contralateral input to a given cerebellar hemisphere comes from motor planning areas of the contralateral cerebral hemispheres by way of the contralateral pontine nuclei. these pontocerebellar fibres constitute the whole of the middle cerebellar peduncle. corticopontocerebellar     input includes information regarding voluntary movement that is being planned or that is ongoing.  what does the cerebellum do with all this information? it coordinates balance, posture &amp; stereotyped mvts it coordinates skilled voluntary movements </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.5XD0SKG8agY" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   the coordination of balance, posture and stereotyped mvts 5 previous next the cerebellum coordinates balance, posture and stereotyped movements such as locomotion, which involve axial      and proximal limb musculature. this function is dependent on three main sources of sensory input: proprioceptive, vestibular and visual.  the portions of the cerebellum involved in using this input to coordinate these types of activities are the flocculus, nodule, vermis and adjacent paravermal regions, i.e. midline structures, and their associated deep nuclei.  the output from these portions of the cerebellum pass through the inferior cerebellar peduncle. it influences balance and gait primarily through the ipsilateral vestibulospinal and reticulospinal pathways, respectively. thus midline lesions of the cerebellum, or lesions of the inferior cerebellar peduncle, lead to disorders of balance and gait.  output from these regions of the cerebellum, also passing through the inferior cerebellar peduncle, coordinates the movement of the eye in the orbit with that of the neck and head via the medial longitudinal fasciculus. an example of this is when you shake your head “no”, but maintain your gaze straight ahead. thus, another sign of such lesions is ataxic eye movements (i.e. ocular dysmetria). </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.67UIyIGh8b5" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   in the clinic: midline cerebellar lesions 6 previous next what do these “disorders of balance and gait” look like? patients with midline cerebellar lesions, or lesions of the inferior cerebellar peduncle, have difficulty maintaining an upright posture, even when seated. they tend to fall toward the side of the lesion. they therefore have difficulty standing with their feet together, and tend to adopt a wide-based stance. the characteristic gait seen with a midline cerebellar lesion is called “cerebellar ataxia”. patients adopt a wide-based gait and their trunk often lurches from side to side. such lesions may affect speech. in “cerebellar dysarthria” patients speech is slurred; it sounds like their tongue is too big for their mouth. such lesions may cause nystagmus and vertigo (week 44) due to involvement of the vestibulocerebellum. </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.5tfS1AZ0E2p" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   the coordination of skilled voluntary movements 7 previous next the coordination and accuracy of skilled voluntary movements, particularly of the hand, is dependent on a comparison of anticipated movement to ongoing movement.  an excellent example of skilled voluntary movements of the hand is seen here: the cerebellum is informed of anticipated movement through the cerebropontocerebellar inputs (blue) received from the contralateral motor and premotor cortices. pontocerebellar fibres make up the whole of the middle cerebellar peduncle. the portions of the cerebellum involved in this function are the lateral portions of the cerebellar hemispheres and their associated deep nuclei.  their output projects via the superior cerebellar peduncle to the contralateral motor cortex via the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (red). thus the cerebellum influences the ongoing output of motor cortex via the cst (green).  signs of lesions of i) lateral portions of the cerebellar hemisphere, ii) the middle cerebellar peduncle or iii) the superior cerebellar peduncle are disordered fine movement of ipsilateral distal limb muscles. </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.6p1ohLgVZ4n" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   in the clinic: hemispheric lesions of the cerebellum 8 previous next what do these “disordered fine movement of distal limb muscles” look like? in the clinic, patients with hemispheric cerebellar lesions, or lesions of the superior or middle cerebellar peduncle, may demonstrate: dysmetria: incoordination of multi-joint movement of the limbs. in the upper limb, this is elicited using the “finger-to-nose test” and is seen in the path between the finger and nose as repeated, side-to-side corrections of course. in the leg, this is elicited using the “heel-to-shin” test. intention tremor: in the finger-to-nose test, at the extreme of the movement (i.e. when the finger approaches the nose or the examiner’s finger), the finger moves up-and-down or side-to-side as the patient attempts to touch the target. dysdiadochokinesia: the patient is unable to perform rapid alternating hand movements. this is elicited by asking the patient to repeatedly tap the palm and dorsum of one hand into the palm of the other, as fast as they can.  remember, cerebrocerebellar lesions, i.e. lesions of the lateral cerebellar hemispheres, cause signs ipsilateral to the lesion. go back to the graphic on the previous slide, if you are unsure as to why this is. </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="69JFIqF0FP8.64cIaQh7GP6" slidebank="false" type="slide">20a   midbrain lesions can cause cerebellar signs 9 previous next the cerebellar peduncles carry information to and from the cerebellum, which passes through the brainstem. therefore, brainstem lesions may cause cerebellar signs. depending on which side of the brainstem the lesion is on, in this case, the signs might be ipsilateral or contralateral to the lesion. midbrain lesions (1) may affect cerebrocerebellar efferents carried in the superior cerebellar peduncle projecting to the vl thalamus and motor areas of the cerebral cortex.  if a midbrain lesion occurs at the level of the superior colliculus, this may result, for instance, in contralateral ataxia coincident with ipsilateral third nerve palsy     . the ataxia is contralateral because the fibres projecting from the cerebellum to the thalamus cross in the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle at the level of the inferior colliculi      . the lesioned fibres are therefore contralateral to the cerebellar hemisphere of origin at the level of the superior colliculi.  </slidetext>
