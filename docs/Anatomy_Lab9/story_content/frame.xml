      <slidetext slideid="5rZOMhDBKCA.5aZHuHM7KZ0" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 9a   the bronchial tree   next previous 14 the right primary bronchus divides into three secondary (lobar) bronchi, one for each of the three lobes of the right lung.  branches of the secondary bronchi are the tertiary (segmental) bronchi. each supplies a volume of lung tissue called a bronchopulmonary segment.  most commonly, the right lung has 10 bronchopulmonary segments (and therefore 10 segmental or tertiary bronchi) and the left lung has 8 or 9. this is because, developmentally, there is greater fusion of the left lung than the right. the trachea bifurcates at the level of the sternal angle into the right and left primary (main) bronchi, each of which supplies a lung. the carina is the cartilage located at the bifurcation of the trachea. the left primary bronchus divides into two secondary (lobar) bronchi, one for each of the two lobes of the left lung. </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="5rZOMhDBKCA.5ityuJED7Lz" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 9a   bronchopulmonary segments   next previous 15 a bronchopulmonary segment is the lung tissue supplied by a segmental (tertiary) bronchus. each segmental bronchus has a companion branch of the pulmonary artery that supplies the bronchopulmonary segment with deoxygenated blood. tributaries of the pulmonary vein that drain a bronchopulmonary segment back to the left side of the heart course through the ct between and around the bronchopulmonary segment.  a bronchopulmonary segment is a functionally independent unit of lung tissue. in addition to its own air and blood supply, it has its own nerve supply and lymphatic drainage. it is the smallest unit of lung tissue that can be removed without affecting adjacent tissue. you are responsible only for the knowledge of what a bronchopulmonary segment is. you are not responsible for learning the names or locations of the various bronchopulmonary segments of the lungs.</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="5rZOMhDBKCA.6RV3InsHzAR" slidebank="false" type="slide">    9a   lymph nodes of the hilum  next previous the main bronchus, the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins are components of the root of the lung, along with its nerves, lymphatic vessels, tracheobronchial lymph nodes and the bronchial arteries. these structures that comprise the root of the lung are bound together by ct, and enter / exit the lung at its hilum     . 16 lymph      from the deep and superficial (subpleural) lymphatics of the lungs drains into tracheobronchial lymph nodes, which are located in the ct around the lobar and primary bronchi, and extend along the trachea and into the posterior mediastinum.  lymphatic vessels arising from the tracheobronchial lymph nodes unite with those draining the parasternal nodes of the anterior chest wall and the brachiocephalic nodes located anterior to the brachiocephalic veins, to form the right and left bronchomediastinal trunks.  the right and left bronchomediastinal trunks empty into the right and left venous angles, respectively.       note the root of the lung is comprised of the group of structures enclosed in ct, whereas the hilum of the lung is the region of the organ where these structures enter / exit. </slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="5rZOMhDBKCA.6LdrgaD0hJn" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 9a   innervation of the lungs   next previous 17 the anterior and posterior pulmonary plexuses are located on their respective sides of the tracheal bifurcation and main (primary) bronchi.  they are formed by contributions from the vagus nerves (parasympathetic preganglionic) and from pulmonary (splanchnic) nerves (sympathetic postganglionic), derived from the sympathetic chain. they also include afferent (sensory) fibres.  mixed autonomic nerves derived from these plexuses enter the hilum of the lung along with its airways, blood vessels and lymphatics. parasympathetic motor fibres stimulate bronchoconstriction and sympathetic motor fibres stimulate bronchodilation.</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="5rZOMhDBKCA.5a0Dw6yN5r5" slidebank="false" type="slide"> 9a   the diaphragm  next previous 18 the diaphragm originates from the inferior thoracic aperture. the posterior attachment of the diaphragm, like the posterior margin of the inferior thoracic aperture, is inferior to its anterior attachment.  when it is relaxed, the diaphragm domes upward. the right side is higher than the left, owing to the bulk of the liver inferior to it.  the striated muscle fibres of the diaphragm are arranged radially, and converge into a large, dense ct central tendon. with contraction, the muscle fibres shorten, pulling the central tendon downward. thus, the diaphragm descends and flattens, increasing the volume of the thorax.  in the central tendon at the level of the t8 vertebra is the caval opening through which the ivc passes from the abdomen to the thorax to empty into the right atrium.  the esophageal hiatus, at the level of the t10 vertebra, is the opening in the central tendon through which the esophagus passes to enter the peritoneal cavity. at the level of the t12 vertebra, the thoracic aorta passes posterior to the diaphragm through the aortic hiatus to become the abdominal aorta.</slidetext>
